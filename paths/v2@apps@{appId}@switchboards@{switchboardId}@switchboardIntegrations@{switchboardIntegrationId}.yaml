  summary: Delete Switchboard Integration
  operationId: deleteSwitchboardIntegration
  description:
    Deletes the switchboard integration. If the deleted switchboard integration
    had an active status for some conversations, the default switchboard
    integration will replace it. Note that it is forbidden to delete a
    switchboard integration if it's the default one (a new one must be chosen
    first) or if another switchboard integration's
    `nextSwitchboardIntegrationId` refers to it. The integration that was linked
    to the deleted switchboard integration will start receiving all conversation
    events, regardless of the switchboard status.
