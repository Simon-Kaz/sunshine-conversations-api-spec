  description:
    Delete a user’s personal information. Calling this API will clear `givenName`, `surname`, `email` and `avatarUrl` and every custom property for the specified user.
    For every client owned by the user, it will also clear `displayName`, `avatarUrl` and any channel specific information stored in the info and raw fields.
    Calling this API doesn’t delete the user’s conversation history. To fully delete the user, see [Delete User](#operation/deleteUser).
