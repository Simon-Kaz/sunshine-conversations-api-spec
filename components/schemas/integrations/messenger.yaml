      Facebook Messenger Setup steps:
      Take note of your Facebook app ID and secret (apps can be created at developer.facebook.com);
      The Facebook app must have been submitted to Facebook for approval with the “manage_pages” (to receive messages through webhook) and “pages_messaging” (to send messages) permissions.
      In order to integrate a Facebook Messenger app you must acquire a Page Access Token from your user. Once you have acquired a page access token from your user, call the Create Integration endpoint with your app secret and ID and the user’s page access token.
