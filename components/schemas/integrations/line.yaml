      For LINE, each of your customers will need to manually configure a webhook in their LINE configuration page that will point to Sunshine Conversations servers. You must instruct your customers how to configure this manually on their LINE bot page.
      Once youâ€™ve acquired all the required information, call the Create Integration endpoint.
      Then, using the returned integration _id, your customer must set the Callback URL field in their LINE Business Center page.
      The URL should look like the following: `https://app.smooch.io:443/api/line/webhooks/{appId}/{integrationId}`.
