description: Carousel messages are a horizontally scrollable set of items that may each contain text, an image, and message actions. Not all messaging channels fully support carousel messages; currently only Facebook Messenger, LINE, Telegram, Viber, the Web Messenger, the Android SDK and the iOS SDK cover the full functionality. For all other platforms a carousel message is rendered as raw text. The raw text fallback does not include any images or postback message actions.
