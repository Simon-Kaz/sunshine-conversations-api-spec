  List messages are a vertically scrollable set of items that may each contain text, an image, and message actions. Not all messaging channels fully support list messages.
  * Facebook Messenger and WeChat have native support.
  * For LINE and our Android, iOS and Web SDK, Sunshine Conversations converts list messages to carousel.
  * On WhatsApp, Telegram and Twitter, Sunshine Conversations converts list messages to multiple rich messages.
  * On all other platforms, Sunshine Conversations converts list messages to raw text.
